# Analysis of Bank Marketing Data Set

The motivation for this project is to apply FCA (aka. Formal Concept Analysis) classification techniques to an UCI dataset. In particular, we have been working with the data of a bank marketing campaign. We have measured the accuracy of FCA to predict whether an object should be classified as a positive class or as a negative one. In this case, we try to predict whether a customer is going to suscribe to the bank promotion or not.
